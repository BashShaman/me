# Methods
 
A method of an obect contains its behaviour. It can be controlled by the values of instance variables of that object. The signature of a method can have parameters. It's mandatory for the caller to pass parameters of the correct type and in the correct order. The signature of a method must contain the return type. It can be `void` if the method doesn't return anything. If the return type is different from `void`, the method must return a value of a compatible type.
