# Objects Comparison

The equality operator (`==`) is used to compare the sequences of bits which are contained within variables. Thus `==` can be used to compare the values of primitive variables or to get to know if to reference variables are tied to the same object.

Use `.equals()` method to compare the content inside objects. It's the way to compare strings, for example.
