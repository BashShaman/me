# My First Zettel

I'm starting my first zettel! Zettelkasten method looks like a promising one. This method is about creating atomic notes and linking them together. The result is an evolving structure which can be utilised to get insights. Thanks to [Mr. Rob][1] for sharing this method with me and other students of his great Boost!
